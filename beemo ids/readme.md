# Beemo ID Extracting

This project is something I made to extract user IDs from a beemo log URL. Normally, you would just need to scroll down to the IDs section, but this gets tedious when the log file gets into the tens, or even hundreds of thousands.

## How to use it

To use this, simply run `go run main.go` inside the directory, and paste the beemo logs URL.
